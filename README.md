## Learned the hard way

Seeing that Jest experience is often cited by employers, I attempted to integrate Jest into my first 4 Next.js projects. Mistake! Since Next.js has updated, Jest no longer plays well. In fact, it's more time consuming attempting to configure Jest than it is to build and deploy the rest of the app. Vitest is the way to go. In about an hour I was able to get 4 tests to pass. Compare that with agonizing days the Jest way.
