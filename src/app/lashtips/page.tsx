            <p className="text-[14px] text-center pb-4">Lash Protocol</p>
            <p className="pb-3">Your lash is a five-second strike. Make it count. 20 words or less. Don&apos;t wimp out. Maximum impact. You&apos;ll see it or hear it every time you slip into mind chatter. That&apos;s the point. It&apos;s a jolt. A snap back to now.</p>
            <p className="pb-3">Start with a trigger. A personal pain point. Something you never want to become.</p>
            <p className="pb-3">Mine? I&apos;ve got several: “Hey Lennon, Taylor Swift, Marshmallow, ShooShoo, ...McFly.”</p>
            <p className="pb-3">Gen X knows that reference. I used to see a future full of promise. Now I fight to avoid ending up soft and aimless. “Hey McFly” stops me cold. It&apos;s sharp. It&apos;s private. It works.</p>
            <p className="pb-3">Your lash follows that trigger. A command. A task. A truth. Tweak it for the day. Adjust it to your mission. If you&apos;re ducking a hard conversation, write a lash that forces your mouth to move. If you&apos;re procrastinating on a problem, make the lash push you to engage.</p>
            <p className="p-3 bg-gray-100 text-[#a1211f] font-mono">You can cry like ShooShoo or you can do a round of weights and 100 count leg lifts.</p>
            <p className="py-3">ShooShoo was my great grandmother, who cried through life, helpless and numbed by drink. You can cry through sorrow or you can sweat through sorrow. Choose the latter. </p>
            <p>Still angry? Good. Use it. Anger is rocket fuel. Screenshot the insult. Use their words for your lash. If it stings, it&apos;s got power. Aim it at your weakness. Fire for effect.</p>

            <p className="pb-3">Shedooby was built to reclaim lost ground. No do-overs. The past is a closed door. The only question that matters now, how do you maximize the present?</p>
            <p className="pb-3">Wherever you stand in life—if you&apos;re still breathing, you&apos;re still in the fight. That background noise between your ears? Mind chatter. Reallocate that wasted wattage. Focus it on your mission set. You&apos;ll be surprised what you&apos;re capable of building when you lock onto your AO (Area of Operations).</p>
            <p className="pb-3">There was a Star Trek episode in which Captain Kirk, Mr. Spock, et al, faced the Earp brothers in a simulation at the OK Corral? The landing party survived not through brute force but belief—mental training. The Vulcan Mind Lock wasn&apos;t sci-fi fluff. It was tactical focus. That is <em>Shedooby</em>. Train your mind to distinguish the real from the distraction. Techno static? Turn that shit off. Focus on targets that matter.</p>
            <p className="pb-3">The image of John Lennon at 40 is an embarrassment to masculinity. Once the apex alpha who excited millions of fertile young women, he was reduced to something soft and infantilized. What the hell happened? What made him surrender? Let this be a warning: Don&apos;t become ornamental. If you&apos;re able-bodied and idle, you&apos;re not living—you&apos;re freeloading. Fix it.</p>
            <p className="p-3 bg-gray-100 text-[#a1211f] font-mono">Hey Lennon. An able bodied, able minded man should earn a living. Get off your wife&apos;s teat. <span className="text-black text-medium">(Reclaim your masculinity.)</span></p>

            <p className="p-3 bg-gray-100 text-[#a1211f] font-mono">Imagine you&apos;re an immigrant. Imagine you can re-invent yourself. Steady pay trumps idleness. That, you don&apos;t have to imagine. <span className="text-black text-medium">(Just like Starting Over.)</span></p>

              <p className="p-3 my-4 bg-gray-100 text-[#a1211f] font-mono">Lose the self-doubt, Marshmallow. Try and fail, no shame. Fail to try, no game. Get in the game. <span className="text-black text-medium">(Playing the game is a better teacher than being a spectator.)</span></p>

Learning to deliver honesty with diplomacy takes practice.)</span></p>

            <p className="pb-3">Ambitious goal? Break it into targets. Stack victories. You want to master the guitar? 10,000 hours. That&apos;s not a sprint. That&apos;s a campaign. Your day&apos;s only 24 hours. Your training time must be intentional.</p>
            <p className="pb-3">I practice guitar one hour a day. That&apos;s 365 hours a year, if I stay sharp. That&apos;s how progress looks: daily, deliberate, and compounding. It&apos;s not fast. It&apos;s not flashy. But it works.</p>
            <p className="pb-3">Guitar&apos;s my second mission. The primary one is earning a living. Manual labor pays today&apos;s bills. Programming is my longer-range goal.</p>
            <p className="p-3 bg-gray-100 text-[#a1211f] font-mono">You have two tasks: practice guitar for 1 hour, program for 2.</p>
